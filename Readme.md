A framework for eliminating boilerplate code in UIKit Views & View Controllers. Read more about it in [Good Swift, Bad Swift — Part 1](https://medium.com/p/f58f71da3575/)

## Why is this even a framework?

I agree, 4 base classes with virtually no implementation doesn't justify a framework. I choose to publish the code here as a framework because that is for most people the easiest way to start using it. I would argue that it is totally fine to just copy paste the classes into your project. I don't anticipate many if any updates to the code here.
